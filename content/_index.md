# Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jonas!

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/jonas.svg" >}}

I'm a developer at [neusta infomantis GmbH](https://www.infomantis.de) and 
work mostly with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) to create wonderful apps for our
clients.
Besides that I'm also a student at [Hochschule OsnabrÃ¼ck (University of applied sciences OsnabrÃ¼ck)](https://hs-osnabrueck.de) and I'm currently working on my 
master thesis in [distributed and mobile applications](https://www.hs-osnabrueck.de/de/studium/studienangebot/master/informatik-verteilte-und-mobile-anwendungen-msc/). 

You can reach and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ue_man) if you want to.

## Sponsor me

I'm working on my packages on my free-time, but I don't have as much time as I would like. If one of the packages I created is helping you, please consider to sponsor me. By doing so, I will prioritize your issues or your pull-requests before the others.
