# Hey üëã I'm Jonas!

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/jonas.svg" >}}

I'm a developer at [neusta infomantis GmbH](https://www.infomantis.de) and 
work mostly with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) to create wonderful apps for our
clients.
Besides that I'm also a student at [Hochschule Osnabr√ºck (University of applied sciences Osnabr√ºck)](https://hs-osnabrueck.de) and I'm currently working on my 
master thesis in [distributed and mobile applications](https://www.hs-osnabrueck.de/de/studium/studienangebot/master/informatik-verteilte-und-mobile-anwendungen-msc/). 

You can reach and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ue_man) if you want to.
