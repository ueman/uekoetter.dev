I've created some nice [libraries for Flutter](https://pub.dev/publishers/uekoetter.dev/packages).

This is a package which tries to make it really easy to gather feedback from 
your users. See [here](https://github.com/ueman/feedback) for more info.

## Unleash

Unleash is a feature toggle service.
[My package](https://pub.dev/packages/unleash) is the recommended unofficial client for Dart as seen in the [official repository](https://github.com/unleash/unleash).

Splash is a collection of alternativ button clicked effects for Flutter.
The [readme](https://pub.dev/packages/splash) shows how they look like.
