## Sponsor me

I'm working on my packages on my free time, but I don't have as much time as I would like to have. If the software I created is helping you, please consider to sponsor me. By doing so, you are really helping me out maintaining it.
I'll also prioritize your issues or your pull-requests before the others.

Thanks! I really appreciate your support.
